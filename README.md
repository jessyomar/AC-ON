Description:

The principal idea of this project is to know if the AC is ON in several rooms in the building across campus.
To make this project we will be using several components. some of them are: a cloud server, an esp32,
a virtual assistant,temperature sensors, wifi connection and Visual Studio Code.
The devices send constant measurementes to a central computer in the cloud and we can see this through display and in the website.
