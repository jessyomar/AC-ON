Description:

The principal idea of this project is to know if the AC is ON in several rooms in the building across campus.
To make this project we will be using several components. some of them are: a cloud server, an esp32,
a virtual assistant,temperature sensors, wifi connection and Visual Studio Code.
The devices send constant measurementes to a central computer in the cloud and we can see this through display and in the website.

Software and tools required for the project:

  The materials used for the implementation of this project were:

-Visual Studio Code, which we used as our development environment
-PlatformIO, an extension of VS Code that helped us with ESP32 programming
-An ESP32 starter kit, which provided us with the necessary hardware
-LMT-84 temperature sensor
-HC-SR04 distance sensor 
-Breadboard and jumper cables
-Red LED, which we used for visual output
-AWS, which we used for cloud computing
-Puttygen and whois.com, which we used for SSH access to the ESP32
-Windows PowerShell, for executing commands on the ESP32
-Node-RED, which we used for IoT automation
-Studio 3T, for managing the database
-Siri virtual assistant connected to node-red and mongodb
-MongoDB, which we used as our database
-An MQTT broker, which we used for message communication
-A 9V battery, used as a power supply for the ESP-32
